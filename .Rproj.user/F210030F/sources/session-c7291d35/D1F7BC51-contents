  description: "I am currently working as a data scientist, developing R packages, creating machine learning models, designing and
evaluating A/B tests, building dashboards, and being the data guy for any ad-hoc reports. The main
tools I am using are R, Shiny, Javascript/Svelte, Python, and SQL. When I am not working my day job,
I am blogging at thatdatatho.com or building web applications about data
that interests me."
