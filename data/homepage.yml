  subtitle: "Data Scientist"
  description: "I am currently working as a data scientist, developing R packages, creating machine learning models, designing and
evaluating A/B tests, building dashboards, and being the data guy for any ad-hoc reports. The main
tools I am using are R, Shiny, Javascript/Svelte, Python, and SQL. When I am not working my day job,
I am blogging at thatdatatho.com or building web applications about data
that interests me."

      description: "For this analysis I continuously scraped real estate data for 3 months and collected data about the Vancouver housing market. I collected publicly available data from the City of Vancouver. In particular, I acquired data sets about schools, parks, places such as grocery stores, restaurants, coffee shops, and public service places. Each of these data sets had latitude and longitude values included. I also acquired data from translink and the police department about crime rates in Vancouver neighbourhoods. With the collected data I created a XG boost model to predict housing prices which can be used the evaluate propeties and if they are listed above or below market value by comparing them to the expected value from the model output."

    - title: "SveltePlots"
      description: "SveltePlots is an interactive visualization package built with Svelte, JavaScript, and D3. This R library is a wrapper for a custom Svelte web component that leverages SVG to create interactive and dynamic charts. SveltePlots includes a limited amount of charts to date which are line and scatter plots, bar charts, density charts, and histograms. <br><br> For the wrapper, I created an R API similar to the ggplot2 package with the help of htmlwidgets to make the visualizations accessible in R reports and Shiny applications. <br><br> 
      <h4>Key Features</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>State Management:</strong> Benefit from Svelte’s exceptional state management to handle dynamic updates seamlessly.</li>
  <li><strong>Ease of Use:</strong> Eliminate the need for proxy functions, renderUI, insertUI, and removeUI in Shiny, simplifying your code and enhancing maintainability.</li>
  <li><strong>Interactive Charts:</strong> Create highly interactive and responsive charts with minimal effort.</li>
  <li><strong>SVG-based:</strong> Utilize SVG for crisp and scalable vector graphics, ideal for a wide range of data visualizations.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Ease of Use</h5>

<h5>Traditional Approach with Proxy Functions</h5>
<p>When using JavaScript-based charting libraries in Shiny:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Proxy Functions:</strong> Proxy functions are created to handle updates to the chart. These functions allow developers to modify certain parts of the chart specification without re-rendering the entire chart. For example, if only the data points change, the proxy function will update just the data-related part of the chart.</li>
  <li><strong>Partial Updates:</strong> By sending only the changes (such as new data points or updated axis labels) to the client-side JavaScript, these functions help maintain performance and responsiveness. This avoids the overhead of re-sending and re-rendering the entire chart.</li>
</ul>

<h5>SveltePlots Approach</h5>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Complete Specification Updates:</strong> Instead of sending partial updates, the entire chart specification is sent to Svelte. This might seem inefficient at first glance, but Svelte’s optimized update mechanism ensures that only the parts of the DOM that need to change are updated.</li>
  <li><strong>Svelte’s Reactivity:</strong> Svelte automatically tracks the dependencies and efficiently updates only the parts of the chart that have changed. This makes it unnecessary to manually create proxy functions and manage partial updates.</li>
</ul>
